You can download the app from the playstore [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brainydroid.daydreamingbeta) or by clicking on the Badge on the right.
Please note that there is no iOS version, the app only works on Android.

## How does it work?

After a short introduction and a few preliminary questions, the app will be running. It contains:

* three <b>psychological questionnaires</b> to fill at any moment within the first three days,
* a couple of <b>questions every morning</b> about your sleep quality,
* a couple of <b>questions every evening</b> about your activities during the past day.

Why? because many mundane things could have a surprising impact on the richness of your mind. Of course information about your mental habits, but also about your sleep quality and how you spend your free time will be useful to get a grasp on what makes your mental life what it is.

And crucially, the app also contains:

* the possibility to <b>describe at any moment your thoughts</b>,
* daily <b>notifications at random moments</b> about the quality of your thoughts

Why? because human’s thought is an ephemeral phenomenon. It is short-lived, and soon cleared from memory as you start attending to other things. The scientific study of thought has been challenging, but we now know that people’s descriptions of their thoughts are the most accurate when they are the most immediate.

Therefore, at any moment, you will be able to describe to the app your thoughts as you were just having them, whether daydreaming or not. Of course, you should not think too much about your thoughts! That is why you will receive notifications asking you questions about your thoughts as you are having them at random moment of the day – with no possibility to anticipate them. Note that these random probes are the most representative of your real trains of thoughts - do not overlook them!

## Why should I use it?

You're participating in a *research project* that might lead to very interesting discoveries in how the human mind works in everyday life. On top of that, you will be *immediately* able to:

* concretely pay attention to each of your own thoughts with the tools of science
* pay attention to specific behaviors and mental habits

*After 30 days* (20 days for early testers), to thank you for your helpful participation, you will also

* receive a detailed report of your real daydreaming style. With it you'll get a unique chance to notice regular and unexpected patterns of your mental functionning that appear only after dozens of observations have been collected.
* be able to share this report on your favorite social medias

*After 60 days*, once enough data will have been collected,

* you will finally reveive a comparison on how your daydreaming style differs from others.
* the app will keep on working. How does your daydreaming style changes with the day of the week, along seasons, if you start a new activity? You will be able to answer these questions by assessing your own data.

## Why use an app for this?

Classical experiments studying mindwandering involve having subjects come to a lab, waiting for them to mind wander and suddenly assessing the content of their thoughts (this is referred to as "thought sampling").

This app does the same thing except that subjects are now anyone using the app in their natural environment. This methodology will allow the assessment of mind wandering in an incredible variety of contexts and activities, and the collection of a large amount of *in vivo* data, impossible to obtain in a lab.
